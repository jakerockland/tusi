- The [Wikipedia page on Tusi couples](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tusi_couple) was a wonderful learning resource
- Got pointed in the direction of the necessary math by [this Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/oddlysatisfying/comments/5p4quf/circle_of_dots_with_every_dot_moving_on_its_own/)
